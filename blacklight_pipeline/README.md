PSC Blacklight de novo assembly, annotation, and read mapping scripts
----
Run these scripts in the following order on PSC Blacklight.  Must be run sequentially, except for *express.PBS*, which can be run simultaneously with *trinotate_annotation.PBS*, since annotation is not needed for mapping
1. **prep_gen**
generates scripts to unzip and concatenate files for downstream analyses
2. **prep.PBS**
runs scripts generated by prep_gen
3. **filter_script_gen**
generates scripts to filter reads
4. **filter.PBS**
runs scripts generated by filter_script_gen
5. **trinity_prep.PBS**
preps files for trinity, concatenating them and performing in-silico normalization
6. **trinity_assembly.PBS**
runs a Trinity _de novo_ assembly
7. **trinotate_annotation.PBS**
annotates transcriptome using Trinotate
8. **express.PBS** (uses **express_batch**)
runs bowtie to map reads and uses express to estimate expression levels
10. **tablet.PBS** (uses **tablet_prep**)
sorts and indexes .bam files from bowtie run, for use in Tablet or other downstream applications
