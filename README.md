Scripts related to RNA sequencing, transcriptomics, and analysis of differential gene expression

Contains three directories:
* blacklight_pipeline
* diff_expression/
* transcriptome_analysis/

--

**blacklight_pipeline/**

de-novo assembly, annotation, and expression estimation in systems without a pre-existing reference

**diff_expression/**

analyze differential expression from files generated in the blacklight pipeline

**transcriptome_analysis/**

get N50, compare histograms from different transcriptomes
