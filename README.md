RNA_seq
=======

Scripts related to RNA sequencing, transcriptomics, and analysis of differential gene expression

Contains three directories:
* blacklight_pipeline
* diff_expression/
* transcriptome_analysis/


**GETTING THESE SCRIPTS**

[Install and setup git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)

Then in a terminal window, "cd" into a relevant directory, and clone this repository into a new_destination_directory within that:

git clone git://github.com/safay/RNA_seq/ <new_destination_directory>

--

**blacklight_pipeline/**

de-novo assembly, annotation, and expression estimation in systems without a pre-existing reference

**diff_expression/**

analyze differential expression from files generated in the blacklight pipeline

**transcriptome_analysis/**

get N50, compare histograms from different transcriptomes
